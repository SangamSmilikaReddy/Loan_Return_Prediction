So our focus is on the precision rate of class 1. From the classification report of the first model, we can see that the precision rate of class 1 is 0.86, or 86%. This means among all the loans identified as to be fully paid by the classification model, 86% of them are actually fully paid. This is a not much better than the repaid rate of the whole test set, which is about 85%. The reason is that the model only has 0.07 recall rate on class 0, which means, for all loans that are charged off, the model only identifies 7% of them as charged off.\n",

In the second model, we set `class_weight='balanced'`. The default RandomForestClassifier is not very senstive to class_weight change, so we also limit `max_depth` to increase the effectiveness of class_weight change.\n",

    "From the classification report of the second Random Forest Classifier, we can see that even though the accuracy rate drops to 65%, the model has a lot larger class 0 recall at 0.44. It means the model identifies 44% of all charged off loans correctly. More importantly, we get better class 1 precission, 88%, which means, among all loans that are predicted as to be fully paid by the model, 88% of them are actually fully paid.\n",

    "\n",
    "$TotalReturn = \\frac{Total Payment}{Funded Amount} - 1$\n",

    "\n",
    "$Annualized Return = (1+Total Return)^{(1/years)} - 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if total return of a 36 month loan is 10%, then annualized return = `(1 + 0.1)**(1/3) - 1` = `0.032`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is not the true annualized return of a loan. But the goal of this project is to identify loans to invest, so we just need a benchmark to evaluate loan portfolio performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cells, we define a function to calculate annual return of a loan portfolio. The function calculates annual return for 36 month and 60 month loans in a portfolio separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we use the `get_portfolio_annual_return()` function to find out the annual returns of all 36 months and 60 months loans in the test dataset. There are 5960 36 months loans, with annual return 2.69%, and 2004 60 months loans, with annual return 2.74%.\n",

    "Comparing to the portfolio selected by rfc2, in the new portfolio, 36 months loan return drops a bit and 60 months loan return increases a bit. But the biggest impact is that in the new portfolio, there are 10 times more 36 months loans than 60 months loans. While in the dataset, the ratio is about 3 to 1. The reason is that since 36 months loans have much higher repaid rate, when we set class_weight='balanced', the model will bias toward 36 months loans."
